## Tools I use
- I prefer to use opera gx as a web browser because it keeps the tabs even after you close your window, this can help prevent losing anything by accidentaly closing the window
- I love note taking on both laptop and on paper, paper as a scribble to get my thoughts down and laptop for actual structured notes
- Word is something i use for cases of writing notes on my laptop as it is easy and efficient
